If you have a BibTeX bibliography, you can import selected entries, including **@string** values, by copying and pasting the entries from your BibTeX file into the textarea.  If you have non-standard fields in your BibTeX entries, WIKINDX will provide you with the option to map them to WIKINDX fields: if you are the administrator, you might like to create custom fields before pasting.  An administrator can post unlimited numbers of entries in one go, other users can post a limited number of entries at a time.
