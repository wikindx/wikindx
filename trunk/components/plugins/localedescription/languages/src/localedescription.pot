"Here, you can set an alternate front page description for each localization "
"you have installed. Alternate descriptions are stored in the "
"plugin_localedescription db table as one row by translation. The original "
"description, set in Admin|Configure, is displayed whenever there are no "
"translation for the prefered locale of a user. You can translate for a very "
"specific locale or a family of languages. For example French in general, or "
"only French (Canada) for Canadian. In the list a locale preceded by an "
"asterisk has a translation."
