This is for users wishing to display a RSS feed ([https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html](W3C RSS 2.0))
of the latest additions or edits on a RSS reader or web site such as a blog.
The RSS is fed from `<wikindxLocation>/index.php?action=rss_RSS_CORE`
which requires some minimal configuration in the __Admin > Configure__  panel.
