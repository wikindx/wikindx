#. When using the word processor, how is singular possessive defined.
#. This is only for a single creator's surname and, like 'et al.' above, is used
#. to detect if a creator name should be removed from the in-text citation
#. if that name is in the same sentence as the citation.
#. If this value contains an apostrophe (as in the English Grimshaw's),
#. then it should be in double quotes (or else the PHP script will fail).

#. translators:
#. You should not translate these abbreviations but establish
#. a list separated by ; of the most common abbreviations of your language
#. or bibliographic styles used in your language (country)
#. THAT END BY A POINT AND ONLY A POINT.
#.
#. It is strongly recommended to leave the Latin abbreviations
#. which are a common place of bibliographies.
#.
#. Remove the English abbreviations unless they are used in your language.
#.
#. Abreviations such as U.S.A., U.S.S.R., N.B. are dealt with in the code
#. (must be capital English characters and no spaces).
#. '...' and multiple dots consisting of two or more dots are dealt with in the code.
#.
#. N.B. MATCHING IS CASE SENSITIVE. You must indicate all the possible cases of an abbreviation.
#.
#. If you have no abbreviations, put a ; in this string.
#.
#. When using the word processor, for certain styles the text
#. must be split up into sentences -- e.g. APA requires that year
#. must follow the author name and page no. follows the citation
#. if the citation appears in the same sentence as the author surname.
#. Normally sentences are recognized by '. ' (dot followed by at least one space).
#. This string handles other groups of characters (commonly abbreviations)
#. that may appear in a sentence // but do not indicate a sentence divider.
#. If there are no such abbreviations, the string must exist and be empty.
#.
#. The Latin abbreviations which are a common place of bibliographies
#. are already included. Do not add them to your list.
#. Latin abbreviations in order of apparition are:
#. - ad loc : ad locum
#. - c. : circa
#. - ca. : circa
#. - cf. : confer
#. - e.g. : exempli gratia
#. - etc. : et cetera
#. - id. : idem
#. - i.e. : id est
#. - loc. cit. : loco citato
#. - loc. laud. : loco laudato
#. - N.B. : Nota Bene
#. - N. B. : Nota Bene
#. - op. cit. : opus citatum
#. - sq. : sequiturque
#. - sqq. : sequunturque
#. - v. : versus
#. - viz. : videre licet
#.
#. English abbreviations in order of apparition are:
#. - short for Brothers (as in Warner Bros.)
#. - company
#. - Figure
#. - figure
#. - number
#. - seconds

#. - doctorate
#. - Manuscript

"<ul>\n"

"<ul>\n"
"<li>A set number of database fields are searched: title; note; abstract; "
"quote; quote comment; paraphrase; paraphrase comment; musing; creator "
"surname; resource keyword; user tag; and any custom fields</li>\n"
"<li>Partial word searches are the default unless the search term is an exact "
"phrase</li>\n"
"<li>You can use control words as noted below</li>\n"
"<li>The restrictions noted below on searches using the abstract and note "
"fields pertain here</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"</li>\n"
"<li><strong>Advanced Search:</strong></li>\n"
"</li>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Complex composite search and select operations may be constructed by "
"adding new fields. Some of these fields can be searched for words or phrases, "
"some can be selected within, and some make use of numerical comparison</li>\n"
"<li>The abstract and note fields are searched on in FULLTEXT BOOLEAN mode. "
"This is a quick and efficient method for searching over potentially large "
"text fields but it dosen't support Chinese and Japanese. In order to do this, "
"your MySQL server must have the requisite parser: see <a href='https://dev."
"mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-restrictions.html'>Full-Text "
"Restrictions</a> in the MySQL documentation. Wildcard characters will be "
"ignored for these two fields</li>\n"
"<li>Document searches can be performed on resource attachments if they are of "
"type PDF, DOC, DOCX, or RTF – searches are carried out on the cached versions "
"of attachments. If you use the first select field to search on attachments "
"any 'NOT' in the search field will be ignored. Attachment searches are not "
"filtered for the list of ignored words (see below)</li>\n"
"<li>The 'OR', 'AND' and 'NOT' radio buttons logically link that set of search "
"parameters to the previous set. For example, five search elements that are "
"sequentially 1 OR 2 AND 3 NOT 4 OR 5 will be grouped as 1 OR (2 AND 3 NOT 4) "
"OR 5</li>\n"
"<li>The structure and logic of the operation may be viewed before searching "
"by clicking on the 'View natural language' icon</li>\n"
"<li>Multiple selections may be made through various combinations of holding "
"(on Windows and Linux) the Control and Shift keys while clicking (on Apple, "
"the Command and Shift keys). Use the arrows to transfer select options "
"between the select box listing those available to use and the select box "
"listing those that will be used</li>\n"
"<li>The select boxes of selected options make use of the radio buttons 'OR' "
"and 'AND'. For example (selecting just the Keyword field to search on), with "
"two or more keywords selected and 'OR' set, each of the returned resources "
"must contain at least one of those keywords.  With two or more keywords "
"selected and 'AND' set, each of the returned resources must contain all those "
