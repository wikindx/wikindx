We can't cover all possible setups. We will restrict ourselves to examples taken from our own development configurations for a local install on a personal computer. 

## WinNMP on Windows

>>> [TODO]


## Apache and mod_php on Debian

>>> [TODO]


## MacOS

We had an example for [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html). Unfortunately it is no longer valid due to the abandonment of the version without VM.

You can use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager to get all the necessary software. This is probably the simplest solution.
