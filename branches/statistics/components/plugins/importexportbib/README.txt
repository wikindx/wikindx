NB. this module is compatible with WIKINDX v5 and up. Versions below 1.6 will work with WIKINDX 4.2.1.

Administrator interface for the importing and exporting of bibliographies.

Default settings are that the module registers itself in the 'plugin1' menu, export options are available 
to registered users and import is only for WIKINDX administrators.  These settings can be changed by 
editing config.php.

Unzip this file (with any directory structure) into plugins/importexportbib/.
Thus, plugins/importexportbib/index.php etc.

Ensure that you are using the latest WIKINDX version before use.

PubMed Import and bibutils (see below) make use of 'bibutils' from http://sourceforge.net/p/bibutils/home/Bibutils/ and written by Chris Putnam.

You will need to download and install the appropriate binaries from the bibutils website above.  By default, the *NIX install path is 
/usr/local/bin/ -- if you install elsewhere, edit both $bibutilsPath variables in plugins/importexportbib/config.php.

PUBMED IMPORT

Search for and download PubMed data in bibTeX format (based on bibUtils v1.1).  The bibTeX file may be optionally immediately imported into WIKINDX.

If 'safe_mode' is 'On' in php.ini then you will need to install the bibutils binaries in the directory specified 
by 'safe_mode_exec_dir'.
