// NB:
// wikindx supports only MySQL with mysqli PHP driver (WIKINDX_DB_TYPE parameter is deprecated).
//
// The database and permissions for accessing it must be created using your RDBMS client. Wikindx
// will NOT do this for you.  If unsure how to do this, contact your server admin. After you have 
// set up an empty database with the correct permissions (GRANT ALL), the first running of Wikindx 
// will create the necessary database tables.
//
// WIKINDX uses caching in the database _cache table for lists of creators, keywords etc.  If you have a large 
// database, you may get SQL errors as WIKINDX attempts to write these cache data.  You will need to increase 
// max allowed packet in my.cnf and restart the MySQL server.
//
// Host on which the relational db management system (i.e. the MySQL server) is running (usually localhost if
// the web files are on the same server as the RDBMS although some web hosting services may specify something like 
// localhost:/tmp/mysql5.sock).
// If your DB server is on a non-standard socket (i.e. not port 3306), then you should set something like localhost:xxxx 
// where 'xxxx' is the non-standard socket.

// (do NOT change after running WIKINDX and creating the tables!).

// other issues associated with such connections. If you set $WIKINDX_DB_PERSISTENT = TRUE

// The auto-detection of the path installation and the base url is an experimental feature

// In this case, you will receive an error message and WIKINDX will die and you should then set that path here.
// The path should be the full path from the root folder to your wikindx folder with no trailing '/'.
// On Apple OSX running XAMPP, for example, the case-sensitive path is:

// WIKINDX usually runs with the standard PHP memory_limit of 64MB.
// With some PHP configurations, however, this is not enough -- a mysterious blank page is often the result.
// If you are unable to update php.ini's memory_limit yourself, WIKINDX_MEMORY_LIMIT may be set (an integer such as 64 or 128 followed by 'M').
// Despite the PHP manual stating that this may not be set outside of php.ini, it seems to work most of the time.
// It is not, however, guaranteed to do so and editing php.ini is the preferred method particularly if your PHP is in 'safe' mode.
// Use double quotes around the value.

// WIKINDX should run fine with the PHP standard execution timeouts (typically 30 seconds) but, 
// in some cases such as database upgrading of a large database on a slow server, you will need to increase the timeout figure.
// If this is FALSE, the value set in php.ini is used.
// Despite the PHP manual stating that this may not be set outside of php.ini, it seems to work most of the time.
// It is not, however, guaranteed to do so and editing php.ini is the preferred method particularly if your PHP is in 'safe' mode.

// Do NOT use quotes around the value.
public $WIKINDX_MAX_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT = FALSE;
// WIKINDX_MAX_WRITECHUNK concerns how many resources are exported and written to file in one go.
// If your WIKINDX contains several thousands of resources and you wish to export them all (e.g. to bibTeX or Endnote),
// then you may run into memory problems which will manifest as either 
// a blank page when you attempt to export or an error report (if you have error reporting turned on). 
// WIKINDX_MAX_WRITECHUNK breaks down the SQL querying of resources and subsequent writing of resources to file into manageable chunks.
// As a rough guide, with a WIKINDX_MEMORY_LIMIT of 64M, WIKINDX_MAX_WRITECHUNK of 700 should work fine and with 64M, 1500 works fine.
// If WIKINDX_MAX_WRITECHUNK is FALSE, the chunk is set to 10,000.
// This can be a tricky figure to set as setting the figure too low increases SQL and PHP execution times significantly.
// Do NOT use quotes around the value.
