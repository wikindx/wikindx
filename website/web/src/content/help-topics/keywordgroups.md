Keyword groups allow the individual user to group semantically similar keywords together so the resources or metadata can then be browsed together. To create a keyword group, at least two keywords must be in the database.

A keyword group is private to the user who created it but the ability to browse them can be shared with one or more user groups (created in _Wikindx > MyWikindx_). When creating a keyword group, adding one or more user groups is not required, likewise the keyword group description: the name and at least two keywords, though, are required.

Once created, the resources belonging to all of the keywords in the group can be browsed in _Search > Browse..._ and metadata can be browsed in the Metadata menu.
