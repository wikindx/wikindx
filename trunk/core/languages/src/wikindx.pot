#. You should not translate this string but establish a list separated by ;

#. If your language does not use it or is incompatible with the operation described
#. below of the word processor, put a ; in this string empty.
#.
#. When using the word processor, how is singular possessive defined.
#. This is only for a single creator's surname and, like 'et al.' above, is used
#. to detect if a creator name should be removed from the in-text citation
#. if that name is in the same sentence as the citation.
#. If this value contains an apostrophe (as in the English Grimshaw's),
#. then it should be in double quotes (or else the PHP script will fail).
#. English has two forms (the second below for names that end in 's').

#. translators:
#. You should not translate these abbreviations but establish
#. a list separated by ; of the most common abbreviations of your language
#. or bibliographic styles used in your language (country)
#. THAT END BY A POINT AND ONLY A POINT.
#.
#. It is strongly recommended to leave the Latin abbreviations
#. which are a common place of bibliographies.
#.
#. Remove the English abbreviations unless they are used in your language.
#.
#. Abreviations such as U.S.A., U.S.S.R., N.B. are dealt with in the code
#. (must be capital English characters and no spaces).
#. '...' and multiple dots consisting of two or more dots are dealt with in the code.
#.
#. N.B. MATCHING IS CASE SENSITIVE. You must indicate all the possible cases of an abbreviation.
#.
#. If you have no abbreviations, put a ; in this string.
#.
#. When using the word processor, for certain styles the text
#. must be split up into sentences -- e.g. APA requires that year
#. must follow the author name and page no. follows the citation
#. if the citation appears in the same sentence as the author surname.
#. Normally sentences are recognized by '. ' (dot followed by at least one space).
#. This string handles other groups of characters (commonly abbreviations)
#. that may appear in a sentence // but do not indicate a sentence divider.
#. If there are no such abbreviations, the string must exist and be empty.
#.
#. The Latin abbreviations which are a common place of bibliographies
#. are already included. Do not add them to your list.
#. Latin abbreviations in order of apparition are:
#. - ad loc : ad locum
#. - c. : circa
#. - ca. : circa
#. - cf. : confer
#. - e.g. : exempli gratia
#. - etc. : et cetera
#. - id. : idem
#. - i.e. : id est
#. - loc. cit. : loco citato
#. - loc. laud. : loco laudato
#. - N.B. : Nota Bene
#. - N. B. : Nota Bene
#. - op. cit. : opus citatum
#. - sq. : sequiturque
#. - sqq. : sequunturque
#. - v. : versus
#. - viz. : videre licet
#.
#. English abbreviations in order of apparition are:
#. - short for Brothers (as in Warner Bros.)
#. - company
#. - Figure
#. - figure
#. - number
#. - seconds
#. - milliseconds
#. - doctorate
#. - Manuscript
