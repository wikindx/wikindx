* ERRORS class (English)
*
* NOTE TO TRANSLATORS:
*           1/  '###' appearing anywhere in an array value will be replaced by text supplied by the core WIKINDX code.
*				Do not remove it.
*			2/  Do not change the key (the first part) of an array element.
*			3/  Ensure that each array element value is enclosed in double quotes "..." and is followed by a comma "...",
*			4/  Both the class name and the constructor name should be changed to match the (case-sensitive) name of
*				the folder your language files are in.  For example, if you are supplying a Klingon translation and
*				your languages/ folder is languages/kn/, the class and constructor name for the file SUCCESS.php
*				must both be SUCCESS_kn.
*
* NOTE TO DEVELOPERS:
*           1/  Any comments not preceeded by '///' at the start of the line will be ignored by the localization module.
*			2/  All comments should be on one line (no line breaks) and must start at the beginning of the line for the localization module to work.
*			3/  Comments must be of the form '/// dbError_ This array does this' where 'dbError' is the array that the comment refers to or may be of the form
*				'/// dbError_open This is the comment' where 'dbError_open' is the exact array and array key that the comment refers to.
