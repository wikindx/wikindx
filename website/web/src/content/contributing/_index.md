# Contributing

We are happy to welcome new contributors.  You can join us to contribute
to the creation of official components or the development of Wikindx.

There is a lot to do, not just development. Contact us!

## Localisation (l10n)

We are looking for translators. If you want to see Wikindx in your
native language do not hesitate to join us on [Transifex].

If you only want to report an error without committing yourself to fixing it,
post it on the [forum] or the wikindx-developers [mailing list].

A _Translation Guide_ is available in the software documentation.
