With the Microsoft Word add-in you can:

- Save and search through multiple wikindices for metadata (quotations, paraphrases, etc.) and references
- Insert metadata and references in your document in a variety of in-text bibliographic styles (e.g., APA, Harvard, MLA as available on the chosen WIKINDX)
- 'finalize' the document. This last step (re)formats the in-text references to the chosen bibliographic style and appends a bibliography in the specified order. You can continue inserting metadata and references and 'finalize' (with different styles and orders) as often as you like.

If your copy of Word is within the 365 corporate Office suite (i.e., Office is managed by your employer), you will need to liaise with your IT support staff in order to use the add-in.
