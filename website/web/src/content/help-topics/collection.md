Here, you can globally edit default values for all collections:

* New collections are automatically created when adding or editing a resource that belongs to a previously non-existent collection.
* The default values are the collection values displayed when adding or editing a new resource that belongs to a collection such as an anthology or a journal. When adding or editing a resource, the default values can be overridden for that resource but the default values for the collection can only be edited here.
* A value in a **Publisher name** field will override any selection in the **Publisher** select box.
* A value in a creator **Last name** field will override any selection in the appropriate **Creator** select box.
* Editing the default values of a collection will update the information for resources within that collection.
