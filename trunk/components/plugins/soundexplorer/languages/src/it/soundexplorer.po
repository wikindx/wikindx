"Sound Explorer will store searches then, at any time in the future, play a "
"sound if a resource matching\n"
"\t\t\t\ta past search is found in a current list operation. This works on the "
"principle of a serendipitous conjunction of past searches\n"
"\t\t\t\twith a current search result, hopefully allowing you to make new "
"creative connections by prodding at the boundaries of your\n"
"\t\t\t\tcurrent conceptual space.  But it is also useful in a multi-user\n"
"\t\t\t\tWIKINDX where it functions like a 'tripwire' signal -- the sound will "
"play if a new resource or metadata has been added by another\n"
"\t\t\t\tuser that matches a stored search (if the resource is being displayed "
"in a list). It is currently an experimental\n"
"\t\t\t\tprototype and has been tested in the Firefox, Safari, and Chrome web "
"browsers. Other browsers are untested."
