I (Mark Grimshaw-Aagaard) originally started developing this as a means to help organise my PhD
research by cataloguing bibliographic notations, references, quotes
and thoughts on a computer via a program that was not tied to a single
operating system (like similar and expensively commercial software) and
that could be accessed from anywhere on the web (unlike other systems).
Additionally, I wanted a quick way to search, for example, for all
quotes and thoughts referencing a keyword or to be able to automatically
reformat bibliographies to different style guides.

As this is a system designed to run on any web server, I thought its
use could be expanded to groups of researchers who could all contribute
to and read the WIKINDX. This concept is very similar to a Wiki
Encyclopaedia where anyone can add or edit entries in an on-line
encyclopaedia.

Since the original ideas, various others have been implemented such as a
wide variety of import and export options and, importantly, the
incorporation of a WYSIWYG word processor that can insert citations and
(re)format them with a few clicks of the mouse. This was powerful
enough for me to write my entire PhD thesis in. (v4 removed this feature
to a plug-in rather than being a core feature.)

The first release of WIKINDX was way back in 2003 and it has been
in continual development since then.
