Ideas are independent of resources and are a means to store thoughts related to the subject matter of the database.

* Ideas are threaded -- new sub-ideas can be added to them.
* The originator of the first idea in the thread is the owner of the thread.
* The owner can set the privacy of the thread (public, private, or group) and changing this will change the privacy settings of the entire thread.
* If threads are public or shared with a group, other registered users can add sub-ideas.
* Only the owner of a sub-idea can edit and delete that sub-idea.
* If the original idea is deleted, then the entire thread is deleted (you will be asked to confirm this).
