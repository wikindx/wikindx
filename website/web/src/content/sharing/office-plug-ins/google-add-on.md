With the Google Docs add-on you can:

- save and search through multiple wikindices for metadata (quotations, paraphrases, etc.) and references
- insert metadata and references in your document in a variety of in-text bibliographic styles (e.g., APA, harvard, MLA as available on the chosen WIKINDX)
- 'finalize' the document. This last step (re)formats the in-text references to the chosen bibliographic style and appends a bibliography in the specified order. You can continue inserting metadata and references and 'finalize' (with different styles and orders) as often as you like.

When co-authoring an academic article, all registered google users you share your document with will have access to the WIKINDX add-on.
