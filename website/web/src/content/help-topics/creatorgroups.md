Select and group multiple creators into one creator (the grouped creators will not be deleted). List operations on the group master will include grouped creators. This is intended for situations where one person may be represented by different creator names but you wish to keep those creator names accurate to the original bibliographic source.

The master of a group cannot be a member of a group, and creators can be members of one group only.

To remove a group, select the group master then remove all its group members.
