Most settings are self-explanatory but some require further explanation.

## For non registered or unlogged users

* **Language/Locale**: The default interface language of WIKINDX is English (United Kingdom). Translations are included in the kernel and updated with new versions as the translators work. Even if a language is not installed, the user can still set the environment locale (for the display of numbers, dates, currencies etc.). In all cases, missing messages in the selected language will be replaced by the default English. If the language option is set to 'Auto,' the set language will be determined by the browser's locale.
* **Paging links**: If a resource list operation returns a high number of resources, this can take time to display. You can, however, define a subset of resources to display in the web browser then use paging links to move onto the next subset.
* **Tag clouds**: Resources can be browsed (under the Search menu) as 'tag clouds' where the size and colour of the font represent relative frequency of the data being browsed.
* **Character limiting**: Sometimes the text displayed in a form select box is long enough to cause problems with the web browser display. This is often the case with journal titles or publisher names. This field allows the user to limit the amount of text with any dropped text being replaced by **...**.
* **Hyperlink view resource**: when viewing a list of resources, the entire resource may be viewed by clicking on the view icon.  Additionally, you may set the entire bibliographic record to be the hyperlink to the resource. In this case, if the bibliographic record contains an external URL (the record is a web page, for example), then the external URL would no longer be hyperlinked.
* **Menu level**: To use the screen space efficiently, WIKINDX makes use of multi-level menus.  These can, however, be difficult to use so you can opt to reduce the number of menu levels. In some cases, the template designer will mandate a certain number of menu levels in which case, attempting to change the number of menu levels for that template will make no difference.

## For registered and logged users

As a registered and logged user, settings here will be saved for the next time you use WIKINDX.

* **BibTeX**:  BibTeX is a bibliographic format familiar to engineers and scientists.
* **CMS**: If the administrator allows it, bibliographic data from WIKINDX may be displayed in Content Management Systems such as MediaWiki, Moodle and WordPress. To aid in this, you can display a **cms** link that provides the data required.
* **User groups**: In a multi-user WIKINDX, registered users can define user groups.  Potentially private information, such as comments on quotations or resource musings, can then be assigned to be viewed only by members of a user group.  Additionally, user groups may collaborate in building a user group bibliography.
* **User bibliographies**: These are drawn from the WIKINDX Master Bibliography and may be personal or managed by a user group. Operations on a user bibliography (such as removing resources from it) have no effect on the WIKINDX Master Bibliography.
* **Email notification**: Receive emails notifying of additions of resources or edits to them. The days figure is a threshold â€“ requirements to notify by email are triggered only when resources are added or edited so that a threshold of 7 days, for example, does not necessarily mean that the notification will be sent immediately following the passing of the threshold, only that the notification will be sent the next time a resource is added or edited.
