## General tips

* Your web browser must accept cookies.
* As WIKINDX functions as a program within a program, you should try not to use the web browser's back and forward navigation buttons but should, instead, use the navigation within WIKINDX.
* WIKINDX uses sessions to temporarily store data and sessions are unique to a web browser instance and the type of web browser.  You may experience unexpected results if you use WIKINDX with more than one web browser window or tab although you can safely do this if the web browsers are different. This will not be the case if the Super Admin has turned on the use of javascript's sessionStorage and your browser is compatible with them.
* A _resource_ in WIKINDX is a collection of data that comprises information forming the bibliographic record, metadata (index card-like information about or taken from the record such as quotations or musings -- the administrator may have disabled this feature), categories, subcategories and keywords. There may also be further information such as notes, abstract, attachments and external URLs in addition to statistical data.
* If you are a registered user, you may create your own user tags and apply them to resources.
* As a registered user, you can also create your own bibliographies drawn from the WIKINDX Master Bibliography.
* Bibliographic formatting is applied in WIKINDX 'on-the-fly' using bibliographic styles compiled and defined by the administrator.  As with any bibliographic style, not all bibliographic data need be displayed. If, for example, you were to search for resources having M. Mouse as a creator, then resources might be returned where M. Mouse is, for instance, a series editor but, due to the requirements of the bibliographic style, is not displayed as such.


## Personal settings

The administrator will have defined default settings but, under the __WIKINDX > My WIKINDX__ or __WIKINDX > Preferences__ menu, you can alter a number of parameters that change the way WIKINDX performs or displays its data. As a registered user, under the My WIKINDX menu, these include:

* Manage your personal details and email notification
* Set up user groups and bibliographies
* Define personal user tags.
